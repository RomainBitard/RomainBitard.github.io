To end his turn he places a card from his hand to a reserve pile</p> <h3 id="if-no-one-has-a-1"><strong>If no one has a 1</strong></h3> <p>Each player put their hand in their reserve piles face up (1 card per reserve pile) Each player draw 5 cards and repeat the discard until a 1 is found, this time each player can discard their cards in any reserve pile they wish.</p> <p>Players <strong>Must</strong> play all of the 1s from their flinch pile or from their hands to the middle of the table, otherwise they may be “Flinched!” (see below) but they don’t need to play any other numbers 1s are never played in reserve piles You <strong>must</strong> play from your flinch pile in priority otherwise you may be “Flinched!”</p> <p>During the game there will be as many middle piles as there are 1s which have been played. Each player can play on each middle pile as long as the cards are played in ascending order and following directly (1 to 15)</p> <h3 id="end-of-turn"><strong>End of turn</strong></h3> <p>To end your turn you place a card on one of your reserve pile. Considerable skill may be used to manage your reserves as you need to remember which cards were put to play them later. It is best to arrange them in descending order, that way you can unfold them 1 by 1 when needed</p> <h1 id="drawing"><strong>Drawing</strong></h1> <p>Whenever you are out of cards you may draw as long as it is still your turn. e.g. if you place your last card on your reserve pile, you won’t draw until your next turn</p> <h1 id="flinching"><strong>Flinching</strong></h1> <p>If a player makes a mistake during his turn, it is considered a “Flinch” and each player can call “Flinch!” at any moment. The first player to successfully call flinch will take his top flinch card and place it at the bottom of the “flinched” player, ending the flinched player turn on the spot.</p> <h2 id="flinch-cases"><strong>Flinch cases</strong></h2> <ul> <li>A player played a card from his reserve or hand before playing from his flinch pile</li> <li>A player played a card from his hand or reserve before playing a 1 from his hand</li> </ul> <h1 id="win-condition"><strong>Win condition</strong></h1> <p>The winner is the first player to successfully get rid of all of the cards in his flinch pile</p> <h1 id="additional-notes"><strong>Additional Notes</strong></h1> <p>An exposed card must be played. e.g. you take a card from your hand, you have to play it and can’t put it back There are no jokers in this game</p> <h1 id="customization"><strong>Customization</strong></h1> <p>You can change the number of decks (from 10 to 20), the number of flinch cards (from 1 to 10) and the max card value (from 5 to 15)</p> <h1 id="checkout-my-other-games"><strong>Checkout my other games</strong></h1> <p><a href="https://onelink.to/gkhhrc"><img src="../../icons/PlayStoresIconsENG.png" alt="My Apps" /></a></p> </main> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

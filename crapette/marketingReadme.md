# Crapette ! 

## Solitaire for people who hate solitaire
Crapette is a Solitaire like except it's in multiplayer, you win when you manage to play all your cards before everyone else.

Similar to Russian bank or "crapette nordique" it has different game mechanics:

3 zones where you can play cards: your opponents, the "go down" zone in the middle and the "go up" zone on the right.

The "Go Down Zone" : you play cards of alternating colors and  of -1 value
(e.g. A black queen on a red king)

The "Go Up Zone" : you play cards of the same suit and +1 value only starting from the Ace (or Excuse for the Trump suit)
(e.g. Ace of diamond then 2 of diamond, ..., Excuse then 1,2,3 of trump ...)

The "Opponent Zone" : you can play cards with a value of +/- 1 your playing card and of a different color (e.g. on a black Queen you can play either a red King or a red Cavalry

Cards ranks from highest to lowest : King (R), Queen(D), Cavalry(C), Jack(V), 10 to 1.
Trump ranks from highest to lowest : 21 to 1 then Excuse (0).
Trump cards follow the same rules as the other cards except they can only played on trumps only.

Before drawing, **think**, is there a card in your discard or on the neutral zone that is playable? If yes you have to play it otherwise you commit a "crapette" and your opponents can take advantage of this at their turn by making you turn two cards.

Crapette is compounding, if someone fail to call another person Crapette it's a Crapette too and she/he can be punished for it.

Check "how to play" in order to visually understand somes rules, or learn by playing if you feel adventurous

(I altered some original rules to make the game more playable in multiplayer)

# **Multiplayer Help**
## **Basics**
Before heading up to multiplayer you should try to play vs bots (first option in the main menu).

Once you get the hang of things you can head out to multiplayer mode.

The main page is listing the public servers, find one that isn't full and click the join button.

Either wait for people to show up or fill the rest of the players with bots (need 2+ players at least).

If you need more players, head to crapette's discord and ask people to come in #find-a-multiplayer-game or #crapette channels.
# **What to do if there are no servers available**
Head to the "Create" tab and create a game to your liking (set a number of players, rope timer, alternative rules, ...).

Share the game code with the people you want to play with (or on discord) and wait for them to join
## **DON'Ts**
Don't minimize your game for too long or your risk getting a timeout !

Especially if you created your own game ! Share the code and go back to the game in fullscreen !
# **Customization**
You can play with different rules if you create your own game in the "Create" tab, select alternative rules and you can play using "Go down" only on other people discards !
# **Bots**
You can fill the room with bots, they are quite strong but they don't play perfectly though ! 
# **I Still Need Help !!**
If you didn't find an answer to your question here, feel free to come to the discord and ask anything !
# **Feedback**
If you have some feedback I'm happy to listen and implement it if it's possible !
